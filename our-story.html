  <p>SEERA NETWORKS, INC. is a global real estate networking company designed to connect its members with leading industry professionals and companies involved in real estate. Launched in September of 2015, SEERA has met with extraordinary success.&nbsp; Embraced for its unique ability to foster professional connections within the real estate community, on both a local and a global scale, the SEERA network is the first of its kind.&nbsp; Considering our network expands only through interpersonal referrals, our 200+ members value being a part of an exclusive professional community specific to real estate. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Besides our growing North American membership, SEERA also features the profiles of a hand-selected collection of businesses and experts from across industries and trades, who are renowned for offering high quality products and services relevant to the real estate market.</p><p>SEERA is the creation of Erin Price Emery, daughter of high profile Vancouver Real Estate agent, Stella Price. Erin designed SEERA as a professional forum to unify our real estate community and to engage our members in the art of networking.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This, however, is not Erin&rsquo;s first professional venture in the real estate field.&nbsp; Born and raised in British Columbia, Erin has developed firsthand knowledge of the region, establishing the basis for her illustrious career in real estate.&nbsp; Growing up in a real estate family that knows the dedication necessary to be successful, it is only natural that Erin chose to channel her sales, marketing and interpersonal skills towards carving out her own niche within the industry. After working in real estate for five years, Erin quickly became a well-respected leader in the industry, now serving as the Director for the Vancouver division of Stella Price and Associates.&nbsp; She avidly leads the Team&rsquo;s Presales and New Development Projects, building connections with industry leaders and clientele, on both a local and a global scale. &nbsp;With Erin directing the Team&rsquo;s Pre-Sales Projects, she has secured the company&rsquo;s place as the Real Estate Leader in the Lower Mainland&rsquo;s Pre-Sales market.</p>
  <p>Recognizing the power of networking, not only as an industry tool, but also a professional art form of sorts, Erin once again joins forces with her mother, Stella Price, to take on their newest professional venture.&nbsp; With this trailblazing Mother-Daughter duo at the helm of SEERA, they are taking the concept of business networking to the next level. &nbsp;</p><p>As an award-winning Vancouver Real Estate Agent with a team that dominates the Lower Mainland&rsquo;s Pre-Sales and Re-Sales markets, Stella brings a wealth of business expertise, industry knowledge, along with both local and global professional connections thanks to the sheer power of her marketing approach. Some of the most highly acclaimed developers, (Mosaic, Townline, Westbank, Anthem Properties, Jim Pattison Group and Reliance, to name a few), have applied Stella&rsquo;s innovative marketing and selling services to maximize their sales, in some cases, even making Stella their Real Estate Ambassador. Stella&rsquo;s connections with leading Pre-Sales Developers allow her to share extraordinary purchasing opportunities and incentives exclusively with SEERA members.&nbsp;</p><p>By bringing Erin and Stella&rsquo;s collective wealth of experience and high profile connections to SEERA Networks, they are well on their way to transforming the face of the real estate business, as we know it.</p><p>Just one year after its inception, SEERA&rsquo;s exclusive real estate network extends across North America and into Asia, currently spanning 12 languages. SEERA&rsquo;s referral-based membership is growing rapidly, successfully connecting like-minded real estate professionals across borders of region, culture and language, all with the common goal of building powerful professional relationships.&nbsp;</p><p align="center"><strong>THE ART OF NETWORKING.</strong></p></div>
