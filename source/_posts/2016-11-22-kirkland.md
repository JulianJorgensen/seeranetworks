The Kirkland is a refined collection of 20 boutique homes on the site of the historic Kirkland Metal Shop in the vibrant heart of Kerrisdale. Established in the 1920s, Kirkland built a reputation of integrity and expertise, serving local residents for decades with all manner of metalwork for their homes.

Recognizing the heritage value of the original building’s architecture, Bogner Developments is preserving and revitalizing the fa&ccedil;ade of the beloved 1920s structure — an important icon of Vancouver history. Bogner has generously incorporated the fa&ccedil;ade into the design of the new building, providing the community with a new collection of homes that complements the evolving fabric of the neighbourhood and the city, while honouring its past.

The residences at The Kirkland are the essence of contemporary luxury, a blend of stately tradition and modern urban elegance. The grand New York-style lobby welcomes you home in style, while the homes’ spacious and inviting interiors are full of light and fine finishes. Kitchens feature exquisite European appliances and the bedrooms are sanctuaries of serenity. Experience a lifestyle of luxurious comfort.
